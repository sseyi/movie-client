This application was designed by, Seyi Solanke as the final capstone project for General Assembly. This single page movie-client application is called "Seen It". It provides an index of movies that allows the users to view, create, update & delete entires as well.

Installation
In order the application to be functional, I utilized npm packages by running the following npm packages

npm run setup
npm install axios


Functionality
On sign-up, a user has the ability to register with their email &  password. Without authentication, the user will be unable to sign-in to gain access to the application. 

On sign-in, a user will be able to sign-in with their email & password. Upon successful sign in the user will be able to execute CRUD functions. 

The User: Users will be able to search movie listing will be provided an index with the following: keys "Title", "Director", & "Year". A user will be able view all movies in the index that allows the users to view, create, update & delete entires as well.


Users will be able to view the nav bar & navigate through the application. Comments (read access) but not able to alter, given that users should be protected against other users deleting comments that negatively reflect the movies that they like.

The front-end of the application utilizes React. Background image & image logo were generated by google search.



Process: I tasked myself with several objectives within the scope of my planning, that would be integral in the successful completion of this process.  1. Conceptualizing: during this process, I searched the web. I needed a reference point as to what others may have done or failed to do in their prior. iterations. Viewing through those designs factored heavily in my decision to keep and simple and clean design. I drafted several wireframes to formulate the layout of the application, with the various required functional features:  i.e sign in sign out buttons and navigation bar. I also used Trello to prioritize & manage my tasks during the course of this first iteration. Once I reached a consensus, on the design & logic, I began to develop code needed for initializing the application. 

GA provided the React template, that provided most of the necessary files needed to create the application. I also utilized some of the previous code from our prior lessons. While implementing the code needed for the user to operate the game successfully, I encountered numerous bugs. To resolve and determine the bugs within my code I enlisted the aid of my classmate. Through peer coding and peer review, I was able to debug many of the user-facing issues that broke the game. I also saw the utility of console logging. I was able to use the react console within the script determine my code stop functioning or had errors when compiled within the web browser.
